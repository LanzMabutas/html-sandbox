      <p>
        This is my page which includes my flasshhhhh work such as the ball and the blow up of my name.
      </p>
      <iframe src="MabutasLanzBallPer7.swf">
           </iframe> <p>This was my ball I liked the design on it and it really looked nice overall. I believe any colors could mix well with this ball. The rotating option and gif look of it is cool</p>
      
<iframe src="Pics/MabutasLanzBlowUpPer7.swf">
       </iframe> <p> This right here was a blow up of my name it seems like a pretty cool thing to do and easier than I thought. I will probably end up doing more of these </p>
      <p>
<iframe src="Pics/MabutasLanzSnowboardPer7.swf"></iframe> <p> This right here is my snowboarder. It looks a little messed up but I think the whole scene is pretty cool. </p>
<iframe src="Pics/MabutasLanzJumpShadowPer7.swf"></iframe>
        <p> I like the shadow effect on this animation. It looks very realistic and I would like to touch up on it some more next time. </p>
        
        <iframe src="Pics/MabutasLanzScrollingBackgroundPer7.swf"></iframe>
        <p> This scrolling background assignment was pretty cool. You can see me chasing down Piccolo and I was moving closer to the screen. </p>
